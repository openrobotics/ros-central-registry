"""Expose the static Python import library so cc_import can link it on Windows.

On Windows the Python C API symbols are __declspec(dllimport), so an extension
module must link the Python import library (python3XY.lib) to resolve them
against the interpreter's DLL at load time. rules_python's current_py_cc_libs
provides that library, but only inside a CcInfo linking context whose owner is
not a node cc_shared_library recognises in its dependency graph -- so the
library is silently dropped from extension links and the PyErr_*/PyExc_* symbols
end up undefined.

This rule simply re-exports the import library's File in DefaultInfo. Feeding it
to a plain cc_import gives the library a genuine cc graph node, which
cc_shared_library links like any other static dependency.
